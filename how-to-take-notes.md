##### How to Take Notes

When taking notes, always keep the following goal in mind:

Goal: **you should be able to read your notes a year or two later and be able to pick up an intuitive understanding of the subject matter**. This means:

- Conciseness is important. However, intuition is more important. If a lengthy explanation gives the reader a better intuition or feel than a shorter one, go with the lengthy explanation.
- Avoid nitty-gritty details unless they have significance.

And remember, *it doesn't matter how good your notes are initially, as long as you upkeep and revise them.*
