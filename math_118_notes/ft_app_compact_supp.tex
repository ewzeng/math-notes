\section{FT Application I: Compact Support}
Compact support is a powerful property that allows us to avoid difficult technicalities. The following is an important example.
\begin{thm}[Shannon-Whittaker]
    Let $f$ we defined so FT, IFT make sense. Then if $\hat{f}$ is continuous, piecewise $C^1$, and supported on $[-\O, \O]$, we have
    \[
        f(t) = \sum^{\i}_{j=-\i} f( \frac{j\pi}{\O}) \sinc(\O t-j\pi)
    \]
    where the series converges uniformly.
\end{thm}
\begin{details}{Proof gist}
    Represent $\hat{f}$ with its Fourier series (which converges uniformly to $\hat{f}$) and then apply IFT. Key trick is to replace $\int_{-\i}^\i$ with $\int_{-\O}^{\O}$.
\end{details}
However, compact support is so powerful that it may be too good to always wish for. For instance, if both $f$ and $\hat{f}$ are compactly supported, one can show using Leibniz's rule that $\hat{f}$ is infinitely differentiable. In fact, with some complex analysis, we can show that $\hat{f}$ is holomorphic! However, the only holomorphic function with compact support is the trivial map.
