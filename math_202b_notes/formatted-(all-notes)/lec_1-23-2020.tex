\begin{dfn}[Quotient Norm]
    If $W$ is a closed subspace of Banach space $V$, then equip $V/W$ with the norm
    \[
        \|\pi(v)\| = \text{inf}\{\|v-w\|: w \in W\}.
    \]
\end{dfn}
\begin{remark}
    Note that if $W$ is not closed, then we only get a semi-norm.
\end{remark}
There are a few miscellaneous statements about quotient norms and spaces, and they often use the following technique:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fix $\pi(v)$. Tweak $v \rightarrow v + w$ until you get a specific property.
\end{itemize}
\begin{exercise}
    Use the tweak technique above to show for any $v \in V$, there is a $\phi \in V'$ such that $\phi(W) = 0$, $\phi(v) = \|\pi(v)\|$, and $\|\phi\| = 1$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{thm}
    $V/W$ is a Banach space.
\end{thm}
\begin{details}{Proof gist}
    ``Pull back" a rapidly Cauchy sequence from $V/W$ to $V$. Tweak technique is needed.
\end{details}
\begin{thm}
    Space of continuous linear operators $\cB(V, W)$ is a Banach space.
\end{thm}
\begin{details}{Proof gist}
    Let $T$ be the point of convergence of a Cauchy sequence. Show $T$ is bounded and linear (very routine).
\end{details}
