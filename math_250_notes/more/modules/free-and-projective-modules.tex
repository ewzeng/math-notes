\section{Free and Projective Modules}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Free $A$-modules have a basis. If $A$ is commutative, the dimension is well-defined. The argument: lift to the category of vector spaces by quoting a maximal ideal, and use the fact that dimension is well-defined there.

    \item Surjective homormophisms to free modules split.

    \item Define $P$ to be a projective $A$-module if it is a direct summand of a free $A$-module. Projective modules are not necessarily free but still possess many nice properties. In fact, $P$ is a projective module iff:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Every surjective homomorphism to $P$ splits.
            \item $\Hom(P, \cdot)$ is exact.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
