\section{Tensor Products}
For abelian groups $M$, $N$, the tensor product $M \otimes N$ arises as the universal object when representing the functor $F$ on the category of abelian groups given by
\[
    F(X) = \Bil(M, N; X),
\]
where $\Bil(M, N; X)$ is the (abelian) group of bilinear maps $M \times N \rightarrow X$. The tensor product is constructed as a certain quotient of the free group
\[
    \bigoplus_{M \times N} \bZ.
\]
As abelian groups are just $\bZ$-modules, we can extend the definition of tensor product to $A$-modules for commutative ring $A$.

\subsubsection{}
\label{tensor-map-construction}
Given an $A$-modules $M$, $N$, and $X$, the correct way to construct a map $M \otimes N \rightarrow X$ is to first define a bilinear map $M \times N \rightarrow X$ and get the corresponding map in $\Hom(M \otimes N, X)$.

\subsubsection{}
We now show that tensor products distribute over direct sums.
\begin{thm}
    Let $M$ be an $A$-module and $\{N_i\}$ be a family of $A$-modules. Then
    \[
        M \otimes \left(\bigoplus N_i\right) = \bigoplus (M \otimes N_i).
    \]
\end{thm}
Following the proof provides a way to understand this on a more intuitive level. The proof goes as follows:
\[
    \begin{split}
        \Hom\left(\bigoplus (M \otimes N_i), X \right) &= \prod \Hom\left((M \otimes N_i), X\right)\\
                                                       &= \prod \Bil(M, N_i; X)\\
                                                       &= \prod \Hom\left(N_i, \Hom(M, X) \right)\\
                                                       &= \Hom\left(\bigoplus N_i, \Hom(M, X)\right)\\
                                                       &= \Bil\left(\bigoplus N_i, M; X\right)\\
                                                       &= \Hom\left(M \otimes \left(\bigoplus N_i\right), X\right).
    \end{split}
\]
