\section{Injective Modules}
Let $M$ be an $A$-module. We say that $M$ is injective if the contravariant functor $\Hom(\cdot, M)$ is exact. As $\Hom(\cdot, M)$ is left-exact for all $M$, an equivalent condition is that every \textit{injective} hom
\[
    N' \hookrightarrow N
\]
induces a \textit{surjective} map
\[
    \Hom(N, M) \rightarrow \Hom(N', M).
\]
Put another way, we can extend every $g \in \Hom(N', M)$ to a homomorphism $h \in \Hom(N, M)$.
\[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        N' \arrow[r, hook] \arrow[d, "g"'] & N \arrow[ld, "h", dashed] \\
        M                                  &                          
    \end{tikzcd}.
\]

Injective modules are the dual of projective modules, so they have many dual properties. For example, if $M$ is injective, every short exact sequence
\[
    0 \rightarrow M \rightarrow N \rightarrow N'' \rightarrow 0
\]
splits. (c.f. the splitting property of projective modules)

TODO: we have Baer's criterion for injective modules. As we have seen, to show module $M$ is injective, we have to show every homomorphism can extend. The proof goes like this:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Incrementally extend homomorphism. Apply Zorn's Lemma to get a maximal extension and show that is what we are looking for.
\end{itemize}
