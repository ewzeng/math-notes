\section{Introduction}
In this set of notes, we go over the basics of field extensions.

Here are some important facts we may use without mentioning:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The ring of polynomials over a field is a PID.
    \item PIDs are UFDs. Prime ideals in PIDs are maximal. Prime elements are also precisely the irreducible elements.
    \item Ring homomorphisms between fields are either trivial or injective (because the kernel is an ideal, and fields do not have nontrivial proper ideals).
\end{itemize}
