\section{Embedding into Algebraically Closed Fields}
Call a field $F$ \textbf{algebraically closed} if every polynomial over $F$ has a root in $F$. In this section, we prove a fundamental result in the theory of fields:
\begin{center}
    Every field $F$ can be embedded inside an algebraically closed field $E$.
\end{center}
The argument is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We show there exists a field $E'$ such that $F \subset E'$ and every (nonconstant) polynomial in $F$ has a root in $E'$.

    \item Applying the previous step iteratively, we get a chain of fields
        \[
            F \subset E_1 \subset E_2 \subset \dots
        \]
        The desired field is then direct limit
        \[
            E = \lim_{\longrightarrow} E_i.
        \]
\end{enumerate}
We elaborate more on the proof for step 1.

\subsection{Step 1: Artin's Argument}
The proof for step 1 is a clever construction of $E'$. The basic idea is to create a variable $X_f$ for every $f \in F[x]$. At the very end of the construction, our goal is to have $X_f$ become the root of $f$ in the field $E'$.

To do this, we let $F[\dots, X_f, \dots]$ be the ring of (multivariable) polynomials over $F$ in the variables $X_f$ for all $f \in F[x]$. Then we define
\[
    E' = \frac{F[\dots, X_f, \dots]}{\mathfrak m}
\]
where $\mathfrak m$ is the maximal ideal containing all the $f(X_f)$ for all $f \in F[x]$.

Note that there is natural inclusion $F \subset E'$. Furthermore, for every $f \in F[x]$, the coset $[X_f] \in E'$ is a root of $f$.

The key technical difficulty is to prove that there exists a maximal ideal $\mathfrak m$ that contains all the $f(X_f)$. As every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal, it suffices to show that the ideal generated by the $f(X_f)$'s is proper. This requires a short but careful argument that we will omit.
