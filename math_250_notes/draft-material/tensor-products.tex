\section{Tensor Products}
For abelian groups $M$, $N$, the tensor product $M \otimes N$ arises as the universal object when representing the functor $F$ on the category of abelian groups given by
\[
    F(X) = \Bil(M, N; X),
\]
where $\Bil(M, N; X)$ is the (abelian) group of bilinear maps $M \times N \rightarrow X$. The tensor product is constructed as a certain quotient of the free group
\[
    \bigoplus_{M \times N} \bZ.
\]
As abelian groups are just $\bZ$-modules, we can extend the definition of tensor product to $A$-modules for commutative ring $A$.

\subsubsection{}
Given an $A$-modules $M$, $N$, and $X$, the correct way to construct a map $M \otimes N \rightarrow X$ is to first define a bilinear map $M \times N \rightarrow X$ and get the corresponding map in $\Hom(M \otimes N, X)$.
