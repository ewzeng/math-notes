\section{Free and Projective Modules}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Free $A$-modules have a basis. If $A$ is commutative, the dimension is well-defined. The argument: lift to the category of vector spaces by quoting a maximal ideal, and use the fact that dimension is well-defined there.

    \item Surjective homormophisms to free modules split.

    \item Projective modules are not necessarily free but still possess many nice properties (splitting, lifting, exact functors, etc.)
    
\end{itemize}
