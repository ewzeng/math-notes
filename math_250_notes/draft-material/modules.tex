\section{Modules}
For ring $A$, define a left $A$-module as a ``vector space" over $A$, i.e. an abelian group with scalar multiplication from $A$ that satisfies all the vector space axioms (except for the fact that $A$ may not be a field).

Here are some miscellaneous properties of modules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Abelian groups are just $\bZ$-modules, so many properties of abelian groups have generalized analogs in the module world.
    \item Defining scalar multiplication of an $A$-module $M$ is the same thing as giving a ring homomorphism $A \rightarrow \Endo(M)$.
    \item The kernels of module homomorphisms are precisely the submodules! No icky vocabulary like ideals or normal subgroups.
\end{itemize}
