\section{The Module Hom Functors}
Given a $A$-module $M$, we have two natural Hom functors from $A$-modules to abelian groups:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Hom(M, \cdot): N \rightarrow \Hom(M, N)$
    \item $\Hom(\cdot, M): N \rightarrow \Hom(N, M)$
\end{itemize}
The first functor is left-exact and the second functor is right-exact. A natural question to ask is: when are both functors exact? The answer, as we'll see, is precisely when $M$ is a projective module.
