\section{Noetherian Rings}
A Noetherian ring is a ring with the property that any ascending tower of ideals
\[
    I_1 \subset I_2 \subset I_3 \subset \dots
\]
eventually stabilizes. In this course, we work primarily with Noetherian rings because they provide the property that any set of ideals has a maximal element. This allows us to perform an analog of regular strong induction known as Noetherian induction (which we will see in proof PID $\implies$ UFD). This induction is more powerful than the transfinite induction of Zorn's Lemma.

A ring is Noetherian if and only if every ideal is finitely generated.
