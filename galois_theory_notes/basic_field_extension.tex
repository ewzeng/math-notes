\section{Notation}
For field $F$, we denote $F[u]$ the smallest field generated by $F$ and element $u$. We $F[u]$ is $F$ extended by $u$. (To be formal, everything takes place in an ambient field).

\section{Basic Field Extension}
It is natural to hope for something like
\[
    F[u] = \{a_0 + a_1u + \dots + a_nu^n : n \in \bZ^+, a_i \in F\}.
\]
This is almost correct.
