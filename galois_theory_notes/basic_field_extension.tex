\section{Notation}
For field $F$, we denote $F[u]$ the smallest field generated by $F$ and element $u$. That is, $F[u]$ is $F$ extended by $u$. (To be formal, everything takes place in an ambient field $E$).

\section{Basic Field Extension}
It is natural to hope for something like
\[
    F[u] = \{a_0 + a_1u + \dots + a_nu^n : n \in \bZ^+, a_i \in F\},
\]
This is almost correct. However, $F[u]$ would not be a field as multiplicative inverses are not guaranteed to exist. We will need to do some tweaks.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Case I: $u$ is not a root of any polynomial in $F$.}
\end{itemize}
