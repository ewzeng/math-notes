\section{Another View of the Spectrum}

Eisenbud develops the spectrum of a ring from a slightly different perspective that well complements Borcherd's lectures, so we also present it here.

Let $R = k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ be the ring of polynomials defined on $k^n$. We make the following definitions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For ideal $I \subset R$ define $Z(I) \subset k^n$ as the set of common zeros of polynomials in $I$. These sets are called \textbf{(affine) algebraic subsets}.
    \item Call an algebraic subset an \textbf{algebraic variety} if it is not the union of smaller algebraic subsets.
    \item For any $X \subset k^n$, define $I(X)$ as the set of polynomials vanishing on $X$.
\end{itemize}
Call an ideal $I$ radical if $I = \sqrt{I}$. Hilbert's Nullstellensatz states that for algebraically closed $k$, there is an (order-reserving) correspondence between radical ideals and algebraic subsets given by the maps
\[
    I \to Z(I), \quad X \to I(X).
\]
One further analysis, one can show:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maximal ideals $\leftrightarrow$ points.
    \item Prime ideals $\leftrightarrow$ algebraic varieties.
\end{itemize}
Thus, $\Spec_m(R) = k^n$ and $\Spec(R)$ is the space of algebraic varieties in $k^n$.
