\begin{itemize}
    \item The parallelogram inequality $\|v+w\|^2 + \|v-w\|^2 = 2(\|v\|^2 + \|w\|^2)$ guarantees a closest point to a convex closed set in Hilbert space $\mathcal H$. This is how we define orthogonal projection.
    \item The decomposition $\ker \phi + (\ker \phi )^ \perp$ is used to construct Reisz Representation.
\end{itemize}
