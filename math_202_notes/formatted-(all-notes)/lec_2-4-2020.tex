\begin{thm}[The Weak Topology is Tight]
    Suppose $V$ is a vector space, and $W$ is a collection of linear functionals on $V$. Then if $\phi$ is a continuous linear functional for the $W$-weak topology, $\phi \in W$.
\end{thm}
\begin{details}{Key trick}
If $\phi_1, \dots, \phi_n$ are a collection of linear functionals, then
\[
    \bigcap \ker \phi_i \subset \ker \phi \implies \phi \in \text{span}\{\phi_i\}.
\]
To show the LHS, we compare the topology generated by $\phi$ with the subbase of the weak topology.
\end{details}

\begin{thm}[Krein-Milman]
Let $C$ be a closed convex subset of a locally convex topological vector space $V$ (assumed Hausdorff). Then the convex hull of extreme points of $C$ is $C$.
\end{thm}

\begin{details}{Main idea}
Consider the poset $P$ of all the faces of $C$. Then the minimal points of $P$ are the extreme points (need Zorn for existence). Then use this property to prove this theorem.
\end{details}

\begin{details}{Key technique}
If $D$ is compact convex set, we consider a continuous linear functional $\phi$ not constant on $D$ (use H-B or H-B separation). Then
\[
    \{v \in D: \phi(v) \text{ achieves its maximum.} \}
\]
is a proper (compact convex) face.
