\section{Lecture 3-19-2020}
Motivation for integral operators come from matrix multiplication. (Side note: integral operators are to matrices as convolution (considered as a type of integral operator) are to Toeplitz matrices. The relation between convolution and FT is the reason that Toeplitz matrices are diagonalized by the FFT.)
\begin{dfn}[Integral Operators]
    For $K \in \cL^p(X\times Y)$, define $T_K: \cL^q(Y) \rightarrow \cL^p(X)$ by
    \[
        T_K(f)(x) = \int K(x,y)f(y)dy.
    \]
\end{dfn}
The above definition makes sense because of Holder ($q$ is chosen to be the Holder conjugate of $p$). Also, as Fubini/Tonelli are important when working with integral operators, we usually assume we are working in a $\s$-finite space.
