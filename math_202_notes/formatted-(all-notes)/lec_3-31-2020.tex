\begin{dfn}
    A compact operator between two normed vector spaces is a linear map that maps bounded sets to totally bounded sets.
\end{dfn}
\begin{remark}
    A equivalent definition is a operator that maps the unit ball to a totally bounded set.
\end{remark}
\begin{thm}
    Integral operators are compact.
\end{thm}
\begin{details}{Proof gist}
    Prove for a simple case ($K = \chi_{E \times F}$) and then extend to for general $K$ via approximation.
\end{details}
\begin{details}{Base Case}
    Note $K = \chi_{E \times F}$ $\implies$ $T_K$ has rank 1. 
\end{details}
\begin{details}{Key trick for generalization}
    Suppose $\mathcal R$ is a ring that generates the $\s$-ring $\mathcal S$. By approximating elements in $\mathcal S$ by elements of $\mathcal R$, we show that every element in $\mathcal L^p(X, \mathcal S, \mu)$ can be approximated by ISFs in $(X , \mathcal R, \mu)$. (This is a general statement; $X$ has no relation to the $X$ in the definition of compact operators.)
\end{details}
