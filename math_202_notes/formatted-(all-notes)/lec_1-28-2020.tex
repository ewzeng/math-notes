\section{Lecture 1-29-2020}
For vector space $V$, the following are equivalant:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The topology on $V$ is the initial topology from a collection of semi-norms on $V$.

    \item The topology on $V$ is translation invariant and has a subbase of convex sets.
\end{itemize}
When the above scenarios occur, we say the topology on $V$ is \textbf{locally convex}.

\begin{thm}[Alaoglu's theorem]
    If $V$ is a normed vector space, then the closed unit ball $B$ in $V'$ is compact for the weak-* topology.
\end{thm}
\begin{remark}
    A possible point of confusion: two different topologies are used in the statement of the theorem. The closed unit ball is defined by the norm-topology, but the actual topology on $V'$ is weak-*.
\end{remark}
\begin{details}{Proof gist}
    Use Tynchoff's theorem to construct a compact space and establish a homeomorphism between that compact space and $B$ with the weak-* topology.
\end{details}
\begin{details}{More detail}
    Define $D_v = \{t \in \bR: |t| < ||v|| \}$. Then consider the map
    \[
        J: B \rightarrow \prod^{\i}_{v \in V}D_v = P
    \]
    given by the (informal) expression
    \[
        J(\phi) \mapsto \prod^{\i}_{v \in V}\phi(v).
    \]
    By comparing the subbases of $B$ and $J(B)$, we conclude they are homeomorphic. To show $J(B)$ is closed (hence compact), we note each element of $P$ determines a function $f$. If $f$ is in the closure of $J(B)$, then by approximating $f$ by elements of $J(B)$, we show $f$ is linear and thus an element of $J(B)$.
