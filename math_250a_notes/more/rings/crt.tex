\section{Chinese Remainder Theorem}
I liked Ribet's exposition of the Chinese Remainder Theorem very much.
\begin{thm}[Chinese Remainder Theorem]
    If the ideals $I_1, \dots, I_n$ are pariwise coprime, then the natural map $A \rightarrow A/I_1 \times \cdots \times A/I_n$ is surjective.
\end{thm}
This form of the theorem is simple to prove and inductive upon. Then the usual CRT follows from noting the kernel of the map is
\[
    \bigcap I_i = \prod I_i.
\]
