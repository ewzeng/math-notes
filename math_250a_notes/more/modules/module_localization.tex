\section{Localization II}
Let $A$ be a commutative ring and suppose $M$ is a $A$-module. Recall we can localize $A$ to get $S^{-1}A$. Then we can construct $S^{-1}A$-module defined as
\[
    \left\{ \frac{m}{s} : m \in M, s \in S\right\}
\]
with an analogous equivalence condition as before.

One interesting property is that localization (as a functor) is exact.
