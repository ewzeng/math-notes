\section{Introduction}
In this note, we will go over the basics of field extensions.

Here are some important facts that we will use:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The ring of polynomials over a field is a PID.
    \item PIDs are UFDs. Nonzero prime ideals in PIDs are maximal. Prime elements are also precisely the irreducible elements.
    \item Ring homomorphisms between fields are either trivial or injective (because fields do not have nontrivial proper ideals).
\end{itemize}
