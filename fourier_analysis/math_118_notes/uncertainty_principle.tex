\section{FT Application II: An Uncertainty Principle}
\begin{dfn}
    Define the dispersion of $f$ at $a$ to be
    \[
        \D_a f = \frac{\int_{-\i}^\i |t-a|^2|f(t)|^2dt}{
        \int_{-\i}^\i |f(t)|^2dt}
    \]
    whenever the RHS makes sense.
\end{dfn}
Note a small dispersion means that $f$ is ``localized" around $a$. We note state an uncertainty principle, which intuitively says that both $f$ and $\hat{f}$ cannot both be localized.
\begin{thm}
    For $f$ such that $\D_a f$, $\D_\a \hat{f}$ make sense,
    \[
        \D_a f \D_\a \hat{f} \geq \frac{1}{4}.
    \]
\end{thm}
The proof of this statement is rather slick, so we before we present the proof, we first provide a historial note.

Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that momentum and position cannot be simultaneously well determined. Physicists in the 20th century generalized the ideas of momentum and position as the following two linear operators:
\[
    \text{Momentum:} \ \frac{d}{dx}: f(x) \rightarrow f'(x), \quad \text{Position:} \ x\mathbbm{1}: f(x) \rightarrow xf(x).
\]
The key mathematical reason behind Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is the fact that the two linear operators do not commute! This is our motivation.
\begin{details}{Proof gist}
    Observe that the operators $ \frac{d}{dx}$ and $x \mathbbm 1$ do not commute.
\end{details}
\begin{proof}
    By translation and multiplication by a phase factor, we may assume $a = \a = 0$. For simplicity of this proof, we also assume $f$ vanishes at $\pm \i$. Then note
    \[
        \begin{split}
            \|f\|\|\hat{f}\| &= \|f\|^2\\
                             &= \langle f, f\rangle\\
                             &= \langle ( \frac{d}{dx})(x\mathbbm 1)f -
                             (x \mathbbm 1)( \frac{d}{dx}) f, f \rangle\\
                             &= \langle \frac{d}{dx}(x \mathbbm 1)f, f\rangle
                             -
                             \langle (x \mathbbm 1)( \frac{d}{dx}) f, f\rangle\\
                             &= \langle (x \mathbbm 1)f, (- \frac{d}{dx})f\rangle
                             -
                             \langle ( \frac{d}{dx}) f, xf\rangle\\
                             &= -2\Re( \langle xf, f' \rangle)\\
                             &\leq 2\|xf\|\|f'\|\\
                             &= 2\|xf(x)\|\|w\hat{f}(w)\|
        \end{split}
    \]
    where the fifth equality comes from the fact that $ \frac{d}{dx}$ is anti-Hermitian (use integration by parts and $f$ vanishing at $\pm \i$).
\end{proof}
