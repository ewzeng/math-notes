\section{Properties of the Fourier Transform}
Of the many properties of the Fourier Transform, the following two are the most imporant. The proofs are straightforward.
\begin{thm}
    Let $f,g \in L^1(\bR)$ where $f * g$ makes sense. Then
    \[
        \widehat{f * g} = \sqrt{2\pi} \hat{f} \hat{g}.
    \]
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}
    Let $f \in L^2(\bR)$ such that FT, IFT make sense. Then $\|f\|_2 = \|\hat{f}\|_2$.
\end{thm}
\begin{details}{Proof gist}
    Show $\cF^* = \cF^{-1}$.
\end{details}
\begin{remark}
    The Fourier transform can be linearly extended to all of $L^2(\bR)$ (although for $f \in L^2-L^1$, the Definition \ref{FT} does not hold). Then by the above theorem, the Fourier transform is a unitary operator on $L^2(\bR)$.
\end{remark}
