\subsection{Uniqueness of Holomorphic Functions}
We would like to show that if two holomorphic functions agree on an open set, they are the ``same." This essentially boils down to the following result:
\begin{thm}
    If $f$ is a holomorphic function defined on a region $\O$ whose zeros have an accumulation point in $\O$, then $f = 0$ on $\O$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    We use a standard trick of connected domains to prove the theorem. In this case, it works like this:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $U$ be the interior of zeros of $f$.
        \item Note $U$ is open, closed (consider the power series around of any accumulation point of zeros), and nonempty.
        \item Thus $U = \O$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
One intuitive way to look at this proof is: power series is the reason for local uniqueness, connectedness extends this property to $\O$.

This result of uniqueness is the key to analytic continuation.
