\section{Homotopy Invariance}
If $f,g: |K| \to |L|$ are homotopic, then the $f$- and $g$-images of any $q$-cycle can be deformed from one to another and thus of the same equivalence class. That is, the induced maps $f_*$ and $g_*$ should be the same.

Now suppose $K$ and $L$ are homotopy equivalent simplices, with $f: |K| \to |L|$, $g: |L| \to |K|$, and $g \circ f \cong Id_{|K|}$ and $f \circ g \cong Id_{|L|}$. Note $Id_{|K|}$ induces the identity map on $H(K)$. Thus, from our previous observation, $(g \circ f)_* = g_* \circ f_*$ is the identity map on $H(K)$. Applying the same logic to $(f \circ g)_*$, we conclude $f_*$ and $g_*$ are inverses. Hence we conclude $H(K)$ and $H(L)$ are the same. That is, \textbf{homology is homotopy invariant}!
