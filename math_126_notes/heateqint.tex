\subsection{Statement}
The heat equation is 
\[
    u_t = ku_{xx}, \quad k > 0.
\]
It is derived via balance laws with Fourier's law of heating, i.e.\ heat flows in the direction of steepest descent.
\begin{details}{Physical Interpretation}
The heat equation can be interpreted as: ``the change in heat is proportional to the concavity of the heat profile." In other words, the change in temperature at point $p$ is proportional to how much hotter/colder the surrounding temperature is.
