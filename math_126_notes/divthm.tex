\section{Divergence Theorem}
A vector field is a smooth map from $\bR^n \rightarrow \bR^n$.
\begin{dfn}
    Let $F$ be the vector field given by $F = (f_1, \dots, f_n)$.
    The divergence of $F$ is given by
    \[
        \nabla \cdot F
        =
        \sum^{n}_{i=1} \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial e_i}.
    \]
\end{dfn}
\begin{details}{Physical interpretation}
    $\nabla \cdot F(x)$ measures the ``outwardness" of the vector field arrows at $x$. In other words, the amount of vector field arrows $x$ spews out minus the amount of arrows $x$ absorbs.
\end{details}
\begin{thm}[Divergence Theorem]
    Let $B \subset \bR^n$, and let $n$ be the normal vector on $\partial B$. Then
    \[
        \int_B \nabla \cdot F = \int_{\partial B} F \cdot n.
    \]
\end{thm}
\begin{details}{Physical interpretation}
    Integrating divergence over $B$ gives the net difference of vector field arrows spewed out and absorbed in $B$. This is, intuitively, the amount of vector field arrows crossing the boundary, i.e. flux.
\end{details}
\begin{remark}
    We do not go into the conditions we impose on $B$ (compact smooth orientable MwB, etc.). Most ``nice" objects work.
\end{remark}
