\section{Introduction}
In this set of notes, we go over some mathematical background on Lie groups and algebras. The first three sections will be important material for studying the hydrogren atom. The last section is a little more scrappy, but presents some mathematical concepts that will come up when studying spin. The reader may find it easier to skip the last section on the first reading.
