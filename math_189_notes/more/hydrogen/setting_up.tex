\section{Setting Up}

\subsection{Generalizing}
The quantum Hamiltonian of the wave equation for an electron in a hydrogen atom is:
\[
    \hat{H} = - \frac{h^2}{2m}\Delta - \frac{Q^2}{|x|}
\]
where $m$ is the mass of the election, $x$ is the (3D) position of the election with respect to a fixed nucleus, and $Q$ is the charge of the electon.

We want to solve this equation. However, it happens that the method of solution in this system is virtually the same as in a general three dimensional quantum system with radial potential. Thus in this set of notes, we choose to generalize and solve the latter system.

The quantum Hamiltonian of the wave equation in a three-dimensional quantum system with radial potential is:
\[
    \hat{H} = - \frac{h^2}{2m}\Delta + V
\]
where $V$ is any radial function in $\bR^3$.
