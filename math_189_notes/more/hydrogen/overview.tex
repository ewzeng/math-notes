\section{Overview}
We now put together what we know about quantum mechanics to study the structure of the hydrogem atom. To aid in reading this set of notes, we lay out a brief overview of the general mathematical machinery for finding eigenvectors of three-dimensional quantum systems with radial symmetry:
