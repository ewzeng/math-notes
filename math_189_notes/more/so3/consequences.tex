\section{Irreducible Representations of SO(3)}
Recall that if $\Pi: \SO(3) \rightarrow \GL(V)$ is irreducible if and only if the induced Lie algebra homomorphism $\pi: \so(3) \rightarrow \gl(V)$ is irreducible. Because we have classified all irreducible representations of $\so(3)$, we only have to figure out which ones are induced by representations of $\SO(3)$.

It happens that the irreducible $\pi$ induced by representations of $\SO(3)$ are the representations that have integer spin. Thus $\Pi$ is irreducible if and only if $\pi$ is irreducible and has integer spin.
